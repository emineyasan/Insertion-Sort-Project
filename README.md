Question 1

[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] .... n

[2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6] .... n-1

[2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27] .... n-2

[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] .... 1


Big O Notation
n!= n*(n+1)/2= (n^2+n)/2 => O(n^2)

Time complexity n^2

The number 18 is in the average case,because it is in the middle of the array.

Question 2

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] ... n

[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] ... n-1

[2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6] ... n-2

[2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6] ... n-3

[2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7] ... n-4
